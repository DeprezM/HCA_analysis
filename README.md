# Analysis of the human healthy airways atlas at single-cell level.
The code is structured in 6 steps each with specific inputs and outputs (available in the data section).

### 1. Primary data analysis
Individual exploratory analysis of each of the 35 samples composing the atlas using Seurat v3 R package. From this initial analysis we obtained a rough estimate of the cell type composition of each samples (to be refined later in the code) and a list of robust marker genes for each cell type obtained across all 35 samples.

Output from this step : Supplementary Table XX

### 2. Preprocessing of the data
